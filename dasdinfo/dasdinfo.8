.TH DASDINFO 8 "Febr 2007" "s390-tools" "Linux Administrator's Manual"
.SH NAME
.B "dasdinfo "
\- tool to read unique id from s390 DASD device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "dasdinfo [-a] [-l] [-u] [-x] [-e] {-i " <busid>
.BI "| -b " <blockdev>
.BI " | -d " <devnode>
.BI "}"
.sp
.BI "dasdinfo [-h] [-v]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dasdinfo 
displays specific information about a specified DASD device.
It is normally called from a udev rule, to provide udev with a unique id string and
additional information (type, serial) for an S390 DASD drive. Udev can use this
information to create symlinks in /dev/disk/by-id and /dev/disk/by-label
to the real device node.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI "-a|--all"
Same as -u -x -l
.TP
.BI "-x|--extended-uid"
Print DASD uid

This option prints the full uid of the DASD. When z/VM provides two
virtual devices that are actually located on the same real device, the
first four tokens of the uid will be identical for both devices.  z/VM
may provide an additional token that can be used to distinguish between
different minidisks. You need both support in the Linux kernel and
z/VM to receive such an additional token.

For z/VM: VM support for the hypervisor injected Special Node Element
Qualifier (SNEQ) (or hypervisor injected self-description data) is
available by applying the PTFs for VM APAR VM64273 on z/VM 5.2.0 and higher.
.TP
.BI "-u|--uid"
Print DASD uid without z/VM minidisk token

z/VM may provide an additional token that can be used to distinguish
between different minidisks (see --extended-uid option).  To remain
compatible with systems that were installed on older Linux or z/VM
levels, the -u option will print the uid excluding any z/VM-provided
minidisk token.

For example, if the extended uid is
IBM.75000000092461.e900.10.00000000000037400000000000000000 then the
uid is IBM.75000000092461.e900.10. If the extended uid contains no
minidisk token, e.g. in an LPAR environment, then both uids are the
same.
.TP
.BI "-l|--label"
Print DASD volume label (volser).
.TP
.BI "-i|--busid " <busid>
Use the bus ID as input parameter, e.g. 0.0.e910.
.TP
.BI "-b|--block " <blockdev>
Use the block device name as input parameter, e.g. dasdb.
.TP
.BI "-d|--devnode " <devnode>
Use a device node as input parameter, e.g. /dev/dasdb.
.TP
.BI "-e|--export"
Print all values (ID_BUS, ID_TYPE, ID_SERIAL).
.TP
.BI "-h|--help"
Print usage text.
.TP
.BI "-v|--version"
Print version number.

.SH EXAMPLES
dasdinfo -u -i 0.0.e910

dasdinfo -u -b dasdb

dasdinfo -u -d /dev/dasdb

All three examples should return the same unique ID for 
the same DASD device, e.g. IBM.75000000092461.e900.10.

In case this uid is not available, dasdinfo will return
the volume label instead, e.g. 0XE910.
