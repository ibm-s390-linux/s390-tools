.SH NAME
vmur \- Work with z/VM spool file queues
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vmur
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.br
.B vmur
.IR vmur_command " [" command_options "] [" command_args ]
.

.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*v program allows to read, create, list, purge, or order files
on the z/VM spool files queues (RDR, PUN, and PRT).

\*v supports the following commands:
.RS 3
.TP 12
.RB "- " receive :
Read a file from the reader queue
.TP
.RB "- " punch :
Create a file on the punch queue
.TP
.RB "- " print :
Create a file on the print queue
.TP
.RB "- " list :
List one or all files on a spool file queue
.TP
.RB "- " purge :
Purge one or all files on a spool file queue
.TP
.RB "- " order :
Position a file at the top of a spool file queue
.
.RE
.PP
The \*v program requires the vmcp kernel module as prerequisite.
For the receive, punch, and print commands the vmur kernel module is also
required, and the corresponding z/VM virtual unit record devices
(in most cases 000c as reader, 000d as punch, and 000e as printer) 
must be set online.
See
.BR chccwdev (8)
for setting devices online or offline.
.
.
.

.br
All trailing padding bytes are
removed from the end of each record read from the virtual reader and
the separator byte is inserted afterwards.
The receive function's output can be piped to
.BR iconv (1)
using the appropriate character sets, for example:
.IP "" 2
# vmur re 7 -b 0x25,0x40 -O | iconv -f EBCDIC-US -t ISO-8859-1 > file

SPOOL command, the default is OFF.  OFF is the initial setting of the
destination value for virtual devices.   Specify ANY to indicate that the
resulting spool file can be processed on any CP output device that meets other
selection criteria, regardless of the device's DEST setting.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB--dist\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies the distribution code to be assigned to the spool files on this punch
or print.  The distribution code, distcode, is a 1- to 8-character value and
appears on the separator page.

If OFF or an asterisk (*) is specified, the distribution code of the spool file
is reset to the distribution code in the system directory.
.SP
