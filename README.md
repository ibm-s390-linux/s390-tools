   - iucvtty:   Application to provide terminal access via z/VM IUCV.
   - ts-shell:  Terminal server shell to authorize and control IUCV terminal
                connections for individual Linux users.
 * ttyrun:
   Depending on your setup, Linux on s390 might or might not provide a
   particular terminal or console. The ttyrun tool safely starts getty
   programs and prevents respawns through the init program, if a terminal
   is not available.

 * cmsfs-fuse:
   Read and write files stored on a z/VM CMS disk. The cmsfs-fuse file system
   translates the record-based EDF file system on the CMS disk to UNIX
   semantics. It is possible to mount a CMS disk and use common Linux tools
   to access the files on the disk.

 * hmcdrvfs:
   Provide (read-only) access to files stored on a (assigned) DVD inserted
   in a HMC drive. The command creates a FUSE.HMCDRVFS filesystem at the
   specified mount point. The feature works with either the LPAR or the
   z/VM hypervisor. But note especially for z/VM that the DVD must be
   assigned to the associated system image (LPAR).

 * hyptop:
   Provide a dynamic real-time view of a s390 hypervisor environment.
   The tool works with the z/VM and LPAR hypervisor. Depending on the available
   data it shows e.g. CPU and memory consumption of active LPARs or z/VM
   virtual guests. The tool provides a curses based user interface similar
   to the popular Linux 'top' command.

 * qethqoat:
   Query the OSA address table and display physical and logical device
   information.

 * zdsfs:
   Mount a z/OS DASD as Linux file system.

 * CPU-measurement facilities (CPU-MF) tools:
   Use the lscpumf tool to display information about the CPU-measurement
   counter and sampling facilities.  Use the chcpumf tool to control the
   sampling facility support. Use lshwc to extract complete counter sets from
   the CPU Measurement Facilities.

 * cpacfstats:
   The cpacfstats tools provide a client/server application set to monitor
   and maintain CPACF activity counters.

 * zdev:
   Provides two tools to modify (chzdev) and display (lszdev) the persistent
   configuration of devices and device drivers that are specific to the s390
   platform.

 * dump2tar:
   dump2tar is a tool for creating a tar archive from the contents of
   arbitrary files. It works even when the size of the actual file content
   is not known beforehand (e.g. FIFOs, sysfs files).

 * netboot:
   Provides simple tools to create a binary that can be used to implement
   simple network boot setups following the PXELINUX conventions.

 * libekmfweb:
   A shared library that provides functions to communicate with an EKMF Web
   server via REST calls over HTTPS. EKMF Web stands for IBM Enterprise Key
   Management Foundation - Web Edition, and is used to manage keys in an
   enterprise.

 * libkmipclient:
   A shared library that provides an KMIP client to communicate with an KMIP
   server. KMIP stands for Key Management Interoperability Protocol, and is an
   extensible communication protocol that defines message formats for the
   manipulation of cryptographic keys on a key management server.

 * hsci:
   Manage HiperSockets Converged Interfaces (HSCI).

 * hsavmcore:
   hsavmcore is designed to make the dump process with kdump more efficient.
   With hsavmcore, the HSA memory that contains a part of the production
   kernel's memory can be released early in the process. Depending on the size
   of the production kernel's memory, writing the dump to persistent storage
   can be time consuming and prevent the HSA memory from being reused
   by other LPARs.

Build and runtime requirements for specific tools
-------------------------------------------------

In the following more details on the build an runtime requirements of
the different tools are provided:

* dbginfo.sh:
  The tar package is required to archive collected data.

* genprotimg:
  For building genprotimg you need OpenSSL version 1.1.0 or newer
  installed (openssl-devel.rpm). Also required is glib2
  (glib2-devel.rpm). Tip: you may skip the genprotimg build by adding
  `HAVE_OPENSSL=0` or `HAVE_GLIB2=0`.

  The runtime requirements are: openssl-libs (>= 1.1.0) and glib2.

* osasnmpd:
  You need at least the NET-SNMP 5.1.x package (net-snmp-devel.rpm)
  installed, before building the osasnmpd subagent.
  For more information on NET-SNMP refer to:
  http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net

* lsluns:
  For executing the lsluns script the sg_luns and sg_inq commands must
  be available. The sg_luns and sg_inq executables are part of the
  SCSI generic device driver package (sg3 utils/sg utils).

* ziomon tools:
  For running the ziomon tools the following tools/packages are required:
  - Packages: blktrace, multipath-tools, sg3-utils
  - Tools: rsync, tar, lsscsi

* cmsfs-fuse/zdsfs/hmcdrvfs/zgetdump:
  The tools cmsfs-fuse, zdsfs, hmcdrvfs, and zgetdump depend on FUSE.
  FUSE is provided by installing the fuse and libfuse packages and by a
  kernel compiled with `CONFIG_FUSE_FS`. For compiling the s390-tools package
  the fuse-devel package is required.
  The cmsfs-fuse tool requires FUSE version 2.8.1 or newer for full
  functionality.
  For further information about FUSE see: http://fuse.sourceforge.net

* hyptop:
  The ncurses-devel package is required to build hyptop.
  The libncurses package is required to run hyptop.
  IMPORTANT: When running hyptop on a System z10 LPAR, the required minimum
             microcode code level is the following:
             Driver 79 MCL N24404.008 in the SE-LPAR stream

* ip_watcher/xcec-bridge:
  As of s390-tools-1.10.0, the minimum required kernel level is 2.6.26.
  For running ip_watcher these programs are required:
  - qetharp (s390-tools)
  - qethconf (s390-tools)
  - route (net-tools)

* zfcpdbf:
  As of s390-tools-1.13.0, the minimum required kernel level is 2.6.38.

* cpacfstats:
  For building the cpacfstats tools you need libpfm version 4 or
  newer installed (libpfm-devel.rpm). Tip: you may skip the cpacfstats
  build by adding `HAVE_PFN=0` to the make invocation. To run the
  cpacfstats daemon the kernel needs to have performance
  events enabled (check for `CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y`) and you need libpfm
  version 4 or newer installed. A new group 'cpacfstats' needs to be
  created and all users intending to use the tool should be added to
  this group.

* zdev:
  Depending on the boot loader and initial RAM-disk mechanism used by a
  Linux distribution, specific steps may be required to make changes to
  the root device configuration persistent. zdev encapsulates this root
  device logic in a helper script called 'zdev-root-update': This script
  is invoked whenever the root device configuration is changed and it must
  ensure that the persistent root device configuration is put into effect
  during boot. zdev provides a sample implementation for zdev-root-update
  which can be selected during the 'make install' step using the `HAVE_DRACUT`
  variable:

  - `HAVE_DRACUT=1` installs a zdev-root-update helper that works with zipl
    as boot loader and dracut as initial RAM-disk provider.

  Distributors with different boot or RAM-disk mechanisms should provide
  a custom zdev-root-update helper script.

  - `ZDEV_ALWAYS_UPDATE_INITRD=1` upon modification of any persistent device
    configuration, chzdev updates the initial RAM-disk by default, without any
    additional user interaction.

  For some distributions, all the configuration attributes must be copied to
  the initial RAM-disk. Because the device configuration directives applied
  in the initial RAM-disk takes precedence over those stored in the root file-
  system. This copying is done usually by explicitly invoking a command. This
  build option makes it user-friendly and does this copying without any manual
  intervention.

  Some functions of zdev require that the following programs are available:

  - modprobe (kmod)
  - udevadm (systemd)

  The following programs are not required but when available will improve
  the functionality of the zdev tools:

  - lsblk (util-linux)
  - findmnt (util-linux)
  - vmcp (s390-tools)
  - ip (iproute2)

* znetconf:
  For running znetconf these programs are required:
  - modprobe (kmod)
  - vmcp (s390-tools)

* zkey:
  For building the zkey tools you need openssl version 0.9.7 or newer installed
  (openssl-devel.rpm). Also required are cryptsetup version 2.0.3 or newer
  (cryptsetup-devel.rpm), and json-c version 0.12 or newer (json-c-devel.rpm).
  Tip: you may skip the zkey build by adding `HAVE_OPENSSL=0`, and you may
  may skip the zkey-cryptsetup build by adding `HAVE_CRYPTSETUP2=0`, or
  `HAVE_JSONC=0` to the make invocation.
  A new group 'zkeyadm' needs to be created and all users intending to use the
  tool must be added to this group. The owner of the default key repository
  '/etc/zkey/repository' must be set to group 'zkeyadm' with write permission
  for this group.

* libekmfweb:
  For building the libekmfweb shared library you need openssl version 1.1.1 or
  newer installed (openssl-devel.rpm). Also required are json-c version 0.13 or
  newer (json-c-devel.rpm), and libcurl version 7.59 or newer
  (libcurl-devel.rpm).
  Tip: you may skip the libekmfweb build by adding `HAVE_OPENSSL=0`,
  `HAVE_JSONC=0`, or `HAVE_LIBCURL=0` to the make invocation.

* hsavmcore:
  For building the hsavmcore tool you need fuse version 2.6 and optionally
  systemd which is enabled by default, to disable systemd support,
  add `HAVE_SYSTEMD=0` to the make invocation.
  Tip: you may skip the hsavmcore build by adding `HAVE_FUSE=0`
  to the make invocation.

* libkmipclient:
  For building the libkmipclient shared library you need openssl version 1.1.1
  or newer installed (openssl-devel.rpm). Also required are json-c version 0.13
  or newer (json-c-devel.rpm), libxml2 version 2.9.10 or newer
  (libxml2-devel.rpm), and libcurl version 7.59 or newer (libcurl-devel.rpm).
  Tip: you may skip the libkmipclient build by adding `HAVE_OPENSSL=0`,
  `HAVE_JSONC=0`, `HAVE_LIBXML2=0`, or `HAVE_LIBCURL=0` to the make invocation.
