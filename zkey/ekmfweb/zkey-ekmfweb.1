.SH NAME
zkey\-ekmfweb \- Key management system plugin for EKMF Web (IBM Enterprise Key
Management Foundation \- Web Edition)
.
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBzkey\-ekmfweb.so\fP library is a key management system plugin for
\fBzkey\fP and provides an interface to \fBEKMF Web\fP (IBM Enterprise Key
Management Foundation \- Web Edition). It allows to integrate the external key
management system EKMF Web into zkey.
.PP
Secure AES keys can be generated in EKMF Web and are then imported into the zkey
secure key repository. The keys can be used to encrypt volumes, the same way
as with secure AES keys generated by zkey locally.
.PP
EKMF Web supports secure keys of type \fBCCA\-AESCIPHER\fP, and requires one or
multiple \fBIBM cryptographic adapters in CCA coprocessor mode\fP of version 6
or later, e.g. a CEX6C.
.
.SS "Bind the zkey secure key repository to EKMF Web"
.
To use EKMF Web with zkey, the zkey secure key repository must first be bound to
the EKMF Web key management system plugin.
.PP
Use the \fBzkey kms plugins\fP command to list available key management system
plugins. The EKMF Web plugin appears as plugin \fBEKMFWeb\fP in the list of
available plugins. If it does not appear, check if it is configured properly in
configuration file \fB/etc/zkey/kms\-plugins.conf\fP. Refer to the \fBzkey\fP
man page for details about this configuration file.
.PP
Use the \fBzkey kms bind EKMFWeb\fP command to bind the EKMF Web key management
system plugin to the zkey repository. You must then configure the EKMF Web
plugin with command \fBzkey kms configure\fP before it can be used.
.
.SS "Display information about the EKMF Web key management system plugin"
.
Use the \fBzkey kms info\fP command to display information about the EKMF Web
key management system plugin and its configuration. If any of the settings are
displayed as \fB'(configuration required)'\fP, then you must configure these
settings before you can use the EKMF Web plugin. Use the \fBzkey kms
configure\fP to do so.
.
.SS "Configure the EKMF Web key management system plugin"
.
Use the \fBzkey kms configure\fP command to configure or re\-configure the
EKMF Web plugin. Use command \fBzkey kms configure \-\-help\fP to display the
possible command line options to perform the configuration.
.PP
Configuring the EKMF Web plugin may be a multi-step task. You can supply all
configuration options at once or use the \fBzkey kms configure\fP command
several times supplying only one or a few configuration options each time.
.PP
The following settings must be configured:
.RS 2
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fBAPQNs\fP associated with the EKMF Web key management system plugin. These
APQNs are used by the EKMF Web plugin to generate internally used secure keys
(i.e. the identity key), as well as to import secure AES keys from EKMF Web into
the zkey repository, enciphered with the current CCA master key. Secure keys
imported from EKMF Web will automatically be associated with the APQNs
associated with the EKMF Web plugin. Use the \fB\-\-apqns\fP option to specify
the APQNs to associate with the EKMF Web plugin.
.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fBconnection to the EKMF Web server\fP. The EKMF Web plugin communicates
with EKMF Web via RESTful web services over HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Secure). Use option \fB\-\-ekmfweb\-url\fP to specify the URL of the EKMF Web
server. The URL should start with \fB'https://'\fP, and may contain a port
number separated by a colon. If no port number is specified, 443 is used for
HTTPS. Additional TLS (Transport Layer Security) specific options can be
specified to control the behavior of the TLS protocol and the validation of the
EKMF Web server's certificate. Use command \fBzkey kms configure \-\-help\fP to
display the possible command line options.
.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fBEKMF Web settings\fP, such as the EKMF Web server's public key and the
key templates used by EKMF Web to generate keys. These settings are
automatically retrieved from EKMF Web, once the connection to the EKMF Web
server has been configured. Use option \fB\-\-refresh\-settings\fP to refresh
the settings, when they have changed in EKMF Web.
.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The secure \fBidentity key\fP used to identify the zkey client with EKMF Web,
and to cryptographically sign requests sent to EKMF Web. The identity key
is a secure key, and is automatically generated once the connection to the
EKMF Web server has been configured. Use option \fB\-\-gen\-identity\-key\fP to
re-generate the identity key, if needed. You must re-generate a
registration certificate with the newly generated identity key and re-register
this zkey client with the EKMF Web server.
.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fBregistration certificate\fP to register the zkey client with EKMF Web.
The registration certificate is an X.509 certificate generated with the secure
identity key. Use option \fB\-\-gen\-csr\fP to generate a \fBcertificate signing
request\fP (CSR) with the identity key. You pass this CSR to a certificate
authority (CA) to have it issue a CA signed certificate for the EKMF Web
plugin. Alternatively, use option \fB\-\-gen\-self\-signed\-cert\fP to generate
a \fBself signed certificate\fP with the identity key for the EKMF Web plugin.
Use options \fB\-\-cert\-subject\fP and \fB\-\-cert\-extensions\fP to specify
the certificate subject name and extensions (if any). To renew an existing
certificate, use option \fB\-\-renew\-cert\fP. The subject name and extensions
are then read from the certificate that is to be renewed.
.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBRegister\fP the zkey client with EKMF Web. Use option \fB\-\-register\fP to
register the zkey client using the \fBregistration certificate\fP from the
previous step. An identity key is generated in EKMF Web using the public
key from the certificate. You may also need to use option
\fB\-\-label\-tags\fP to specify the label tags for creating the identity key
in EKMF Web. Use command \fBzkey kms info\fP to find out which label tags the
identity key template uses.
.RE
.
.SS "Re-encipher the secure identity key"
.
Use the \fBzkey kms reencipher\fP command to re-encipher the secure identity
key of the EKMF Web plugin with a new master key.
The secure identity key must be re-enciphered when the \fBAPKA master key\fP
of the CCA cryptographic adapter changes.
.PP
See the man page of \fBzkey\fP for a description of the the \fBzkey kms
reencipher\fP command.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP The \fBzkey kms reencipher\fP command does \fBnot\fP re-encipher
secure keys that have been generated by or have been imported from EKMF Web and
are now stored in the secure key repository. Use the regular \fBzkey
reencipher\fP command to re-encipher those secure keys.
.
.SS "Generating secure AES keys with EKMF Web"
.
Use the \fBzkey generate\fP command to generate secure AES keys in EKMF Web and
import the newly generated key into the secure key repository. When the zkey
repository is bound to the EKMF Web plugin, then the \fBzkey generate\fP command
always generates the keys in EKMF Web, except when the \fB\-\-local\fP
option is specified.
.PP
Keys generated in EKMF Web are always of type \fBCCA\-AESCIPHER\fP. The
cryptographic size of the keys depend on the underlying EKMF Web template.
Use \fBzkey kms info\fP to display the names of the key templates configured.
If option \fB\-\-key\-bits\fP is specified, it must match the key size in the
template.
.PP
You may need to use option \fB\-\-label\-tags\fP to specify the label tags
for creating keys in EKMF Web. Use command \fBzkey kms info\fP to find out
which label tags the configured key template uses.
.PP
Keys generated with EKMF Web are bound to EKMF Web, and also inherit the APQN
association from the EKMF Web plugin. You cannot associate different APQNs to
a key that is bound to EKMF Web. Other additional information can be associated
with a secure key as usual, using the \fB\-\-description\fP, \fB\-\-volumes\fP,
\fB\-\-volume\-type\fP, or the \fB\-\-sector\-size\fP options. This associated
information is also stored in EKMF Web with the key.
.
.SS "Remove secure keys bound to EKMF Web from the key repository"
.
Use the \fBzkey remove\fP command to remove an existing secure key from the
secure key repository. If the key is bound to EKMF Web, then you can also
change the state of the key in EKMF Web, while removing it. Use option
\fB\-\-state\fP to specify the new state of the key in EKMF Web. If no state is
specified, the key remains unchanged in EKMF Web, but is removed from the local
secure key repository only.
.
.SS "Change secure keys bound to EKMF Web"
.
Use the \fBzkey change\fP command to change the description, the associated
volumes, the sector size, and the volume type of a secure key contained in the
secure key repository. If the key is bound to EKMF Web, then the changed
information is also updated for the key in EKMF Web.
.PP
You cannot change the associated cryptographic adapters (APQNs) of a key that
is bound to EKMF Web, because it inherits the APQN association from the EKMF
Web plugin. To change the APQNs associated with the EKMF Web plugin, use the
\fBzkey kms configure\fP command with the \fB--apqns\fP option. This also
changes the APQN associations of all secure keys in the secure key repository,
that are bound to the EKMF Web plugin.
.
.SS "Rename secure keys bound to EKMF Web"
.
Use the \fBzkey rename\fP command to rename an existing secure key in the
secure key repository. If the key is bound to EKMF Web, then the new name
is also updated for the key in EKMF Web. Note that the key label as it
is known in EKMF Web cannot be changed. Only the associated zkey name is
updated.
.
.SS "List secure keys managed by EKMF Web"
.
Use the \fBzkey kms list\fP command to display eligible secure keys managed by
EKMF Web. You can filter the displayed list by key label, key name, associated
volumes, and volume type. Refer to the man page of \fBzkey\fP for the details
on these filter options.
.PP
Use option \fB\-\-states\fP to filter the list by the key state in EKMF Web.
You can specify multiple states, separated by comma. If this option is omitted,
then only keys in \fBACTIVE\fP state are displayed.
.PP
By default, only keys are displayed, which this zkey client is allowed to use.
Only keys where the export control options include the identity key of this zkey
client as allowed exporting key can be used by this zkey client.
Specify option \fB\-\-all\fP to also list keys that this zkey client is
not allowed to use. The EKMF Web operator can change the export control options
of a key to allow a certain zkey identity key to export the key.
.
.SS "Import secure keys managed by EKMF Web into the repository"
.
Use the \fBzkey kms import\fP command to import secure keys managed by EKMF Web
into the secure key repository. You can filter the list of keys to be imported
by key label, key name, associated volumes, and volume type. Refer to the man
page of \fBzkey\fP for the details on these filter options.
.PP
Only keys are imported, which this zkey client is allowed to use. Only keys
where the export control options include the identity key of this zkey
client as allowed exporting key can be used by this zkey client. The EKMF Web
operator can change the export control options of a key, to allow a certain
zkey identity key to export the key.
.
.SS "Refresh secure keys bound to EKMF Web"
.
Use the \fBzkey kms refresh\fP command to refresh secure keys that are bound to
EKMF Web. You can filter the list of keys to be refreshed by name, associated
volumes, volume type, and key type. Refreshing a key updates the secure key by
re-importing it from EKMF Web. Use option \fB\-\-refresh\-properties\fP to also
update the associated information, such as the textual description, associated
volumes, volume type, and sector size, with the information stored with the key
in EKMF Web. Refer to the man page of \fBzkey\fP for the details on the \fBzkey
kms refresh\fP command.
.PP
The \fBzkey kms refresh\fP command can also help if the secure keys have not
been re-enciphered properly after a CCA master key change, and thus became
invalid. By refreshing the keys using the \fBzkey kms refresh\fP command, the
secure key is re-imported under the current CCA master key. So this command
could also be used as an alternative to the \fBzkey reencipher\fP command for
keys that are bound to EKMF Web.
.
