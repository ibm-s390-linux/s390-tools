.SH DESCRIPTION
Use the \fBzkey\fP tool to generate and manage secure AES keys that are
enciphered with a master key of an IBM cryptographic adapter in CCA coprocessor
mode. You can also use the \fBzkey\fP tool to validate and re-encipher secure
AES keys.
.PP
The secure keys can either be stored in a file in the file system, or
in the secure key repository. The default location of the secure key repository
is \fB/etc/zkey/repository\fP. Set environment variable \fBZKEY_REPOSITORY\fP
to point to a different location to use a different secure key repository
location. Keys stored in a secure key repository inherit the permissions from
the repository directory (except write access for other users, which is always
denied). The default repository location \fB/etc/zkey/repository\fP is created
with group \fBzkeyadm\fP as owner and mode \fB770\fP. Thus all secure keys
created in that repository are owned by group \fBzkeyadm\fP. Anyone that
is supposed to access secure keys in the secure key repository must be part of
group \fBzkeyadm\fP.
.PP
When storing the secure key in a key repository, additional information, such as
a textual description of the key, can be associated with a secure key.
You can associate a secure key with one or multiple cryptographic adapters
(APQNs) that are set up with the same CCA master key.
You can also associate a secure key with one or multiple volumes
(block devices), which are encrypted using dm-crypt with the secure key. The
volume association also contains the device-mapper name, separated by a colon,
used with dm-crypt. A specific volume can only be associated with one secure
key.
.PP
The generated secure key is saved in a file with a size of 64 or 128 bytes.
The file contains an AES key with a length of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The key is
enciphered with the master key of the CCA cryptographic adapter.
Secure keys that are used for the XTS cipher mode can be 128 or 256 bits
in size.
.
.
.
.SH COMMANDS
The \fBzkey\fP tool can operate in two modes. When argument
.I secure\-key\-file
is specified then it operates on the secure key contained in the specified file.
This applies to commands \fBgenerate\fP, \fBvalidate\fP, and \fBreencipher\fP.
When the
.B \-\-name
option is specified then it operates on a secure key contained in the secure
key repository.

.PP
Use the
.B generate
command to generate a new secure AES key either randomly within the CCA
cryptographic adapter, or from a clear AES key specified as input. When specifying
a clear key as input, the clear key should be kept in a secure place, or be
securely erased after creation of the secure key. The secure key itself does
not need to be kept secure, because it can only be used together with a
CCA cryptographic adapter that contains the master key with which the secure
key was generated.
.PP
The generated secure key can either be stored in a file in the file system,
or in the secure key repository. To store the generated secure key in a
file, specify the file name with option \fIsecure\-key\-file\fP. To store the
secure key in the secure key repository, specify the name of the key using the
.B \-\-name
option. When storing the secure key in a key repository,
additional information can be associated with a secure key using the
.B \-\-description

.RB [ \-\-verbose | \-V ]
.PP
Use the
.B validate
command to validate an existing secure key.
It checks if the specified file or repository entry contains a valid secure key.
It also displays the attributes of the secure key, such as key sizes, whether
it is a secure key that can be used for the XTS cipher mode, the master key
register (CURRENT or OLD) with which the secure key is enciphered, and other key
attributes. For further information about master key registers, see the
\fBreencipher\fP command.
.PP
The secure key can either be contained in a file in the file system, or in a
secure key repository. To validate a secure key contained in a file, specify
the file name with option \fIsecure\-key\-file\fP. To validate secure keys
contained in the secure key repository, specify the name of the key
or a pattern containing wildcards using the
.B \-\-name
option. When wildcards are used you must quote the value.
If neither option \fIsecure\-key\-file\fP nor option
.B \-\-name
are specified, then all secure keys contained in the key repository
are validated.

.RB [ \-\-verbose | \-V ]
.PP
Use the
.B reencipher
command to re-encipher an existing secure key with a new master key.
A secure key must be re-enciphered when the master key of the CCA
cryptographic adapter changes.
.PP
The CCA cryptographic adapter has three different registers to store
master keys:
.RS 2
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fBCURRENT\fP register contains the current master key.
.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fBOLD\fP register contains the previously used master key.
Secure keys enciphered with the master key contained in the \fBOLD\fP
register can still be used until the master key is changed again.
.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fBNEW\fP register contains the new master key to be set.
The master key in the \fBNEW\fP register cannot be used until it is made
the current master key. You can pro-actively re-encipher a secure key with the
\fBNEW\fP master key before this key is made the \fBCURRENT\fP key. Use the
.B \-\-to-new
option to do this.
.RE
.PP
Use the
.B \-\-from\-old
option to re-encipher a secure key that is currently enciphered with
the master key in the \fBOLD\fP register with the master key in the
\fBCURRENT\fP register.
.PP
.PP
If both the
.B \-\-from-old
and
.B \-\-to-new
options are specified, a secure key that is currently enciphered
with the master key in the \fBOLD\fP register is re-enciphered with the
master key in the \fBNEW\fP register.
.PP
If both options are omitted, \fBzkey\fP automatically detects whether the
secure key is currently enciphered with the master key in the \fBOLD\fP
register or with the master key in the \fBCURRENT\fP register.
If currently enciphered with the master key in the \fBOLD\fP register,
it is re-enciphered with the master key in the \fBCURRENT\fP register.
If it is currently enciphered with the master key in the \fBCURRENT\fP
register, it is re-enciphered with the master key in the \fBNEW\fP register.
If for this case the \fBNEW\fP register does not contain a valid master key,
then the re-encipher operation fails.
.PP
The secure key can either be contained in a file in the file system, or in a
secure key repository. To re-encipher a secure key contained in a file,
specify the file name with option \fIsecure\-key\-file\fP. To re-encipher
secure keys contained in the secure key repository, specify the name of the key
or a pattern containing wildcards using the
.B \-\-name
option. When wildcards are used you must quote the value.
You can also specify the
.B \-\-apqns
option to re-encipher those secure
keys which are associated with the specified cryptographic adapters (APQNs).
You can use wildcards for the APQN specification.
When wildcards are used you must quote the value.
If both option
.B \-\-name
and option
.B \-\-apqns
are specified then all secure keys
contained in the key repository that match both patterns are re-enciphered.
If all both options are omitted, then all secure keys contained in the key
repository are re-enciphered.
.PP
Re-enciphering a secure key contained in the secure key repository can be
performed \fBin-place\fP, or in \fBstaged\fP mode.
.PP
\fB"In-place"\fP immediately replaces the secure key in the repository with
the re-enciphered secure key. Re-enciphering from \fBOLD\fP to \fBCURRENT\fP is
performed in-place per default. You can use option \fB\-\-in-place\fP to force an
in-place re-enciphering for the \fBCURRENT\fP to \fBNEW\fP case. Be aware that
a secure key that was re-enciphered in-place from \fBCURRENT\fP to \fBNEW\fP
is no longer valid, until the new CCA master key has been made the current one.
.PP
\fBStaged\fP mode means that the re-enciphered secure key is stored in a
separate file in the secure key repository. Thus the current secure key is still
valid at this point. Once the new CCA master key has been set (made active), you
must rerun the reencipher command with option \fB\-\-complete\fP to complete the
staged re-enciphering. Re-enciphering from \fBCURRENT\fP to \fBNEW\fP is
performed in staged mode per default. You can use option \fB\-\-staged\fP to force
a staged re-enciphering for the \fBOLD\fP to \fBCURRENT\fP case.
.PP
.B Note:
The \fBreencipher\fP command requires the CCA host library (libcsulcca.so)
to be installed. For the supported environments and downloads, see:

You can filter the displayed list by key name, associated volumes, associated
cryptographic adapters (APQNs), and volume type. You can use wildcards for the
key name, associated APQNs, and associated volumes. The device-mapper name of an
associated volume can be omitted; if it is specified then only those keys are
listed that are associated with the specified volume and device-mapper name.
.PP
The
.B list
command displays the attributes of the secure keys, such as key sizes,
whether it is a secure key that can be used for the XTS cipher mode, the textual
description, associated cryptographic adapters (APQNs) and volumes, the
sector size, the key verification pattern, and timestamps for key creation, last

option. You cannot use wildcards. The remove command prompts for
a confirmation, unless you specify the
.B \-\-force
option.
.PP
.B Note:
When removing a secure key that is associated with one or multiple volumes,
and the key's volume type is \fBplain\fP,
a message informs you about the associated volumes. When the secure key is
removed, these volumes can no longer be used, unless you have a backup of the
secure key. For keys with volume type \fBluks2\fP no such message is issued,
because the secure key is contained in the LUKS2 header.

option to generate cryptsetup commands for the specified volume type only.
Specify the
.B \-\-run
option to run the generated cryptsetup commands.
.P
For LUKS2 volumes, the generated \fBcryptsetup luksFormat\fP contains
option \fB\-\-pbkdf pbkdf2\fP to set \fBPBKDF2\fP as password based key
derivation function. LUKS2 volumes typically default to \fBArgon2i\fP as
password based key derivation function, but this might cause out-of-memory
errors when multiple encrypted volumes are unlocked automatically at boot
through /etc/crypttab. Because PAES uses secure AES keys as volume keys, the
security of the key derivation function used to encrypt the volume key in the
LUKS key slots is of less relevance.
.P
For LUKS2 volumes, a passphrase is required. You are prompted for the
passphrase, unless option
.B \-\-key\-file
is specified. Option
.B \-\-tries
specifies how often a passphrase can be re-entered. When option
.B \-\-key\-file
is specified, the passphrase is read from the specified file. You can specify
options
.B \-\-keyfile\-offset
and
.B \-\-keyfile\-size
to control which part of the key file is used as passphrase. To avoid confirmation
question, one can specify
