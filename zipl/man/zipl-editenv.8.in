.SH NAME
zipl-editenv \- zIPL environment editor.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zipl-editenv
[OPTION] [ARGUMENT]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zipl-editenv
is a tool to manipulate with zIPL environment of partitions, prepared for
initial program load (IPL) by
.B zipl(8)
utility. This tool performs atomic updates of boot data without modifying the
boot record referencing that data. The following operations are supported:
.IP "     -"
Print environment
.IP "     -"
Assign a specified value to any environment variable
.IP "     -"
Remove a specified variable from the environment
.IP "     -"
Remove all variables from the environment
.PP

.B zIPL environment
(don't confuse with shell environment!)
is a set of variables with their values. All the variables are identified by
their unique names. Names of zIPL environment variables have to satisfy POSIX
requirements for shell environment variables (IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).
That is, such names should consist solely of uppercase letters, digits, and
the '_' (underscore) from the characters defined in Portable Character Set and
should not begin with a digit.

zIPL environment is defined per boot partition by a special boot component
called
.B zIPL environment block.
This component is used for evaluation of variables in another boot component,
kernel command line.
zIPL environment variables can be used in kernel parameter string, where they
should be specified by their names as ${NAME}. During boot, such variables
are replaced with their current values, as defined by the installed environment.

Maximum number of zIPL environment variables per boot partition is 512.

zIPL environment is installed every time when preparing a device for initial
program load (IPL) by
.B zipl(8)
utility. At installation time the environment by default is imported from
user-editable file
.B '/etc/ziplenv'.
That default location can be overridden by respective
.B zipl(8)
option.

Installed zIPL environment (AKA zIPL environment block) can be accessed
(modified, printed) by this
.B zipl-editenv(8)
tool. All modifications made with this tool don't affect the file
.B '/etc/ziplenv'.
Hence, those modifications will be lost after the next boot record
re-installation, unless
.B '/etc/ziplenv'
was updated respectively.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-h" " or " "\-\-help"
Print usage information, then exit.

.TP
.BR "\-v" " or " "\-\-version"
Print version information, then exit.

.TP
.BR "\-t <TARGET DIRECTORY>" " or " "\-\-target <TARGET DIRECTORY>"
Specify a directory, where the environment was installed. This directory should
contain boot data (bootmap file). Default value is "/boot". A similar option
with the same name exists also for
.B zipl(8)
utility.

.TP
.BR "\-l" " or " "\-\-list"
Print zIPL environment, that is a list of all zIPL environment variables with
their current values.

.TP
.BR "\-s <NAME=VALUE>" " or " "\-\-set <NAME=VALUE>"
Assign value
.B VALUE
to the variable with name
.B NAME.
.B NAME
has to satisfy the requirements above.
.B VALUE
may consist of any printable characters different from the new line symbol.
If variable with such name didn't exist in the environment,
then it will be added.

.TP
.BR "\-u <NAME>" " or " "\-\-unset <NAME>"
Remove the variable with name
.B NAME
from zIPL environment.

.TP
.BR "\-r" " or " "\-\-reset"
Remove all variables from zIPL environment.

.SH FILES

.B /etc/ziplenv
- "initial environment" (or "environment file").

A regular file containing zIPL environment to be installed every time when
preparing a device for initial program load (IPL) by
.B zipl(8)
utility.
Don't confuse environment file with environment block!
In contrast with environment block, environment file is not a boot component
and is not used at boot time by any boot processes.
This file contains pairs
.B NAME=VALUE
delimited by new line symbols (i.e. each pair on a separate line).
.B NAME
is identified as a sequence of characters before the leftmost '=' in the line.
.B NAME
has to satisfy the requirements above. Lines beginning from "#" are ignored.
Lines with not identified
.B NAME
are ignored. If lines contain identical names,
then only the last one takes an effect. If the file defines more than 512
variables, or if the environment defined by that file doesn't fit to the
environment block, then
.B zipl(8)
will fail to import such file.

This file can be modified, using any suitable text editor.

.SH NOTES

Any installed zIPL environment (environment block) should be accessed only
by this
.B zipl-editenv
tool. Using other ways to access the environment block is not allowed.
