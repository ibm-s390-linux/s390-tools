 * For exact details and clarifications see document SA23-2260-06 and

 *
 * Counter definitions vary, depending on machine and version numbering.
 * The CPU Measurement facility has a first and second version number.
 *
 * The first version number governs basic counter set and the
 * problem state counter set. Currently used are first verion numbers 1 and 3.
 * The counter numbers are identifical for version number 1 and 3, but
 * have different purpose and description.
 *
 * The second version number governs the crypto counter set. Currently used
 * are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Numbers 1 to 5 use the same counter numbers
 * and definitions. Number 6 adds 4 more deflate counters but leaves
 * the other counters in this counter set unchanged.
 *
 * The second version number also governs the extended counter set range.
 * The definition of each extended counter set is machine specific and
 * determined by machine number. Extended counter set ranges are:
 * Second version number and range:
 * Second version number: 1	Range 128 to 159 inclusive (32 counters)
 * Second version number: 2	Range 128 to 175 inclusive (48 counters)
 * Second version number: 3,4,5 Range 128 to 255 inclusive (128 counters)
 * Second version number: 6     Range 128 to 287 inclusive (160 counters)
 *
 * The second version number also governs the MT-diagnostic counter set range.
 * Second version number: 1,2,3 none installed
 * Second version number: >3    Range 448 to 495 inclusive (48 counters)
