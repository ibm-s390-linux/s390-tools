.SH DESCRIPTION
The cpacfstats client application interacts with the cpacfstatsd daemon and
triggers actions. The application enables, disables, resets, and fetches
one or all of the mainframe CPACF performance counters with the help of the
daemon process.

All counters are initially disabled and must be switched on to measure
CPACF activities of the system. There is a slight performance penalty with
CPACF counters enabled.

Note: All cryptographic counters are bound to physical CPUs. If you use
dedicated CPUs for your LPAR, you obtain only your CPACF activities. If
your CPUs are shared with other LPARs, their cryptographic activities might
distort the results. CPACF performance counters are available on LPARs
only. For security reasons only members of the group \fIcpacfstats\fR are
allowed to run the cpacfstats client application.

Example usage scenario:
.P
1. Start the cpacfstatsd daemon with root privileges.
.P
2. Check for successful startup by using the ps and syslog commands.
.P
3. Enable the CPACF counters of interest. For example, enable all counters
by issuing cpacfstats -e.
.P
4. Run your applications.
.P
5. Display counter values by using the cpacfstats command. Reset the
cryptographic counters as required. To reset, use, for example, cpacfstats
-r.
.P
6. Disable all the CPACF measurements, for example, by using cpacfstats
-d.
.P
7. Shutdown the cpacfstatsd daemon by using killall cpacfstatsd.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR or \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help information for the command.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR or \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version and copyright information for the command.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR or \fB\-\-enable\fR [counter]
Enable one or all CPACF performance counters. The optional counter argument
can be one of: \fBdes\fR, \fBaes\fR, \fBsha\fR, \fBprng\fR or \fBall\fR. If
the counter argument is omitted, all performance counters are
enabled. Enabling a counter does not reset it. New events are added to the
current counter value.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR or \fB\-\-disable\fR [counter]
Disable one or all CPACF performance counters. The optional counter
argument can be one of: \fBdes\fR, \fBaes\fR, \fBsha\fR, \fBprng\fR or
\fBall\fR. If the counter argument is omitted, all performance counters
are disabled. Disabling a counter does not reset it. The counter value is
preserved when a counter is disabled, and counting will resume using the
preserved value when the counter is re-enabled.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR or \fB\-\-reset\fR [counter]
Reset one or all CPACF performance counters. The optional counter
argument can be one of: \fBdes\fR, \fBaes\fR, \fBsha\fR, \fBprng\fR or
\fBall\fR. If the counter argument is omitted, all performance counters are
reset to 0.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR or \fB\-\-print\fR [counter]
Display the value of one or all CPACF performance counters. The optional
counter argument can be one of: \fBdes\fR, \fBaes\fR, \fBsha\fR, \fBprng\fR
or \fBall\fR. If the counter argument is omitted or if there is no
argument, all performance counters are displayed.
.TP
The default command is --print all.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.IP 0
Successful program execution.
.IP 1
An error occurred, reasons include: invalid argument, cpacfstatsd could not
be reached (check that the daemon is running), insufficient access rights,
version mismatch between client and daemon, or the application is out of
memory. The application prints a message with the details of the error and
the errno value.
